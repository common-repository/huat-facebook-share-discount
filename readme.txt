== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I sign up for an Facebook Developer account? =

You can sign up using this link: https://developers.facebook.com/ then Add a New App (Website) and fill in all the necessary fields. 

= How do I resolve this error "Can't Load URL: The domain of this URL isn't included in the app's domains. To be able to load this URL, add all domains and subdomains of your app to the App Domains field in your app settings." when I click on the Facebook Share button in the cart page? =

Login to your Facebook Developer account > Select the App that you created > Settings > Basic > App Domains > If your website is example.com then enter  example.com > Save Changes.

Note: If you are using http://localhost/* format in your wordpress, it would probably not work with Facebook application. You can resolve this issue by specifying a port in your localhost e.g. localhost:3000 or customize the localhost to use a format like wordpress.localhost.com .
